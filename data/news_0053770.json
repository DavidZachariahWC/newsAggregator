The U.S. government had previously backed Peru to join the 35-member Paris-based OECD but is reconsidering after the resignation of President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski. \nA representative of Brazil’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs confirmed that a meeting between U.S. and Brazilian negotiators took place but declined to comment on its content. Calls and an emailed request for comment to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative were not immediately answered. \nThe demands are the latest step in discussions between U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration and the United States’ No. 2 steel supplier after it threatened to slap steep tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports. \nBrazil currently charges a 20 percent tariff on ethanol imports surpassing 150 million tonnes a quarter in a bid to shield local farmers from foreign competition. \nMeanwhile, sanctioning the Open Skies deal, which deregulates flights between the United States and Brazil and was approved by Brazil’s Senate earlier this month, would clear the way for a partnership between American Airlines Group Inc and LATAM Airlines Group SA . \nZanotto said the U.S.-Brazil negotiations could conclude as soon as next week. \nBrazil exported $3 billion worth of iron ore-based products to the United States in 2017. That is a fraction of last year’s $67 billion trade surplus but still a boost to the Brazilian economy as it emerges from the deepest recession in decades.
